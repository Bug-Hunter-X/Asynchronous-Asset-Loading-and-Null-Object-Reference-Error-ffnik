This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error related to asynchronous asset loading.  The `bug.as` file shows code that attempts to access a loaded image before the loading process is complete, leading to a null object reference error. The `bugSolution.as` file presents a corrected version that uses event listeners to ensure the asset is loaded before accessing its properties.
